## DuckDuckGo CLI - you make a request, and the search engine gives the first link.

### Installation.

**1.** Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/aiivy782/duckduckgo-cli` or `wget https://github.com/aiivy782/duckduckgo-cli`

**2.** Go to folder: `cd duckduckgo-cli`

**3.** Make *.sh* file executable: `chmod 777 duckcli.sh`

**4.** Execute! `./duckcli.sh`

### Known problems.

You cannot set a request in Termux and therefore you will simply be moved to the default browser.
